This is my attempt on attacking a password secured system using side channel attacks

### This is a university assignment

Steps that i should probably take:

1) What are Side Channel Attacks? Why do they exist and how can we use them to our "benefits"

2) Setup a bunch of experiments and find out how a microcontroller compares 2 integers, or perhaps Strings. Does the complexity of the password,
change the behaviour of the microcontroller?

3) How can we capture and process this change in behavior to get to data that we usually dont see?

4) Rob a bank... (Not assigned by university)
